# [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

#### *Note:* Always start component names with a capital letter.
React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, \<div \/>

### Props are Read-Only
The components functions or classes should be pure.
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
