# Rendering Elements

An element describes what you want to see on the screen
Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

### Rendering an Element into the DOM
If an app is build completely based on the React, it will have single root element usually
```JS
<div id="root"></div>
```

If integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like
Ex: [Try rendering multiple root element](https://github.com/HimanshuAgrahari07/react-training/blob/26f4d08da1b06f01746b955bb22819bb04d03936/src/index.js)

### Updating the Rendered Element
React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or attributes.
The only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render()
